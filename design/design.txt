Website Design
* Note that this is merely a basic txt file for my ideas; the formal SWE steps will be done slowly and carefully
* I would like to use Flux Architecture for complete functionality of the site; views are obviously being rendered
  by React atm. I'll likely use Redux since it seems to fit my needs.


NEXT:
I've installed react-bootstrap. I'd like to change the image of the jumbotron as the routing changes.
The text does actually change right now... but I need to update the path that is displayed
to something more human readable...
Also add parallax effect to jumbotron.
