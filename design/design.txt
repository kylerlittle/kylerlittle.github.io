Website Design
* Note that this is merely a basic txt file for my ideas; the formal SWE steps will be done slowly and carefully
* I would like to use Flux Architecture for complete functionality of the site; views are obviously being rendered
  by React atm. I'll likely use Redux since it seems to fit my needs.


NEXT:
I would like to use bootstrap. I think I'll make a jumbotron (since bootstrap can handle
the responsiveness) for my header. I'll overlay the navbar and have it be transparent.
Then, I'll change the image of the jumbotron as the routing changes.

STRUCTURE
_App
  |_Header
     |_Jumbotron
        |_Title (kylerlittle.github.io  <div className="route-text" $currentRoute </div>) ==> update responsively
	   |_Style route-text differently than site name
	|_Navbar (transparent, no blocks, white text)
  |_Main
     |_Route (render the appropriate component based on route)
