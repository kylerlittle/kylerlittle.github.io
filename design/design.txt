Website Design
* Note that this is merely a basic txt file for my ideas; the formal SWE steps will be done slowly and carefully
* I would like to use Flux Architecture for complete functionality of the site; views are obviously being rendered
  by React atm. I'll likely use Redux since it seems to fit my needs.


NEXT:
- Make navbar responsive. It's almost there; just needs a little fixing.

- Get Header in shape. Start with styling the navbar; then, work on SVG transition
