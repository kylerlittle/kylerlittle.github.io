I'm just your average student-athlete world traveler nerd.

Here's an unordered list of interesting things about myself:
* I study mathematics and computer science at Washington State University (WSU).
* Some technical topics that interest me are graph algorithms and machine learning.
  * [This](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/C9LWnT6EpmBCQB) is a paper I wrote on path finding using common graph searching algorithms. Eventually, [this repository](https://github.com/kylerlittle/maze-viz) will contain code that'll generate randomized mazes, solve them using the various path finding algorithms I wrote about in my paper, and animate the algorithms themselves.
  * [Here](https://github.com/kylerlittle/perceptron) is an implementation and animation of the perceptron machine learning algorithm.
  * [This repository](https://github.com/kylerlittle/machine-learning) contains my homework assignments from my machine learning course at WSU. If you want to see some beautifully written LaTeX reports and some probably much less beautiful Python code, check it out.
* Me and my friends, Zack and Parker, got into HackMIT last fall by being one of the first 50 teams to solve their admissions puzzles. We utilized machine learning to create an intelligent web application that determines the accuracy of a given news article.
* Last summer, I studied abroad in Lima, Peru. I had to speak in Spanish for basically five weeks straight. I visited Machu Picchu and the Amazon. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXvyFoT9HGc&app=desktop) is video of a monkey stealing my water bottle.
* I run cross country and track at WSU. I love the steeplechase. It's a 3000m track race with hurdles. There are five hurdles (actually, steeple barriers) per lap, where one of them is a "water" barrier. Confused? Check [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSC5CZhjC5V/?taken-by=kylerlittle) out. My personal best is 8:59.85, which is 4:49.6 / mile pace.
* I'll be a software engineering intern at Tableau Software this summer. I'm hyped.

Here is an artsy picture of myself near Pike Place Market in Downtown Seattle.

FYI, this is the base Jekyll theme. I'll experiment with other gem-based themes from [here](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jekyll-theme). If I don't like any of those, I'll write my own.
