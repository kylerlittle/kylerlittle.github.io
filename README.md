# Personal Website

**[Link](https://kylerlittle.github.io)** 

__Description:__
This will be a project I continually work on throughout the next year and quite possibly longer. I may migrate this site to completely different frameworks as I become more proficient with web design. However, I'd like to keep the core content up-to-date in some form or another. For now, I'll be using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and a Front-End Framework which I haven't decided upon yet.

The website's main purpose will be to serve as a blog. I have a lot of things to talk about, and I need to share them with the world. In no particular order, the topics will be:
* Interesting Technical Topics
   * If I find the topic interesting enough, I might write a guide on it.
   * Otherwise, it will probably be a short summary of the topic and why it's cool.
* Interviewing Advice
* Diary-Style Entries
   * I enjoy traveling, and I'd love to blog about cool places I've been and how to get there for yourself.
   * Etc.
* YSPKT (You Should Probably Know This)
   * In my opinion, these are topics you should know about these things. You don't need to agree with me, but you should be informed enough to have an opinion. These articles will serve as that information source.
* More to come!
